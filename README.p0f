p0f support
---------------------------
support for OS detection duing discovery can be compiled in by adding the --with-p0f flag at build time
and supplying the path to the p0f socket in panoptes_config.xml.  In order for detection to work correctly,
you must pass the -A flag to p0f, ie:

p0f -pdqAQ /var/run/p0f.sock -o /dev/null

You can get p0f from http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f.shtml
